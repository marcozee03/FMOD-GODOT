		Place in the scene to set the position of the fmod listener(s). Number of

		same index will lead to undefined behavior.

			Listener weighting is a factor which determines how much the listener influences the mix. It is taken into account for 3D panning, doppler, and the automatic distance event parameter. A listener with a weight of 0 has no effect on the mix.

			Listener weighting can be used to fade in and out multiple listeners. For example to do a crossfade, an additional listener can be created with a weighting of 0 that ramps up to 1 while the old listener weight is ramped down to 0. After the crossfade is finished the number of listeners can be reduced to 1 again.

			The sum of all the listener weights should add up to at least 1. It is a user error to set all listener weights to 0.
